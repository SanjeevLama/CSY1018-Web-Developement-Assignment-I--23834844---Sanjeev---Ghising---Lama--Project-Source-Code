                    <h3><span class="header-border">Experience on the module</span></h3>
                    <p>I've learned a lot of topics in my web development module up to this point that was brand-new to me. I initially believed it would be difficult, but after some time, I became accustomed to it. Throughout this semester, I experienced many highs and lows. I occasionally ran into issues with my programming and had to spend time troubleshooting. The subjects covered in the web development module ranged from CSS, which styles the website page and its content, to HTML, which structures the website page and its content. The course covered a wide range of areas and began from its foundation. I acquired the skills to organize and style my website using HTML and CSS. In my first instruction, I learned how to insert paragraphs, headings, and images. I learned to design a table and a form.After learning about CSS, I was able to style my websites. I created the structure using div elements and styled it with CSS. I found using CSS to design websites to be very interesting. I had fun designing the website with CSS. I also gained knowledge in card creation. Many different codes are used in CSS to design pages. I've learned some fundamental techniques so far, but there is still a lot to learn. The lesson also discussed Github's applications. At first, using GitHub was very challenging but with the assistance of my tutor and peers, I was able to become familiar with it. In my leisure time, I picked up additional knowledge not covered in class. I am using the skills I've acquired to create websites that interest me in my spare time.</p>

                    <h3><span class="header-border">Development of site</span></h3>
                    <p>After receiving a university assignment and following its directions, a portfolio website that displays my coding abilities and personal data was created. Now let's discuss the user experience of the website:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Background</b>:The backdrop of my website is a lovely combination of purple and the color of the setting sun. I chose this backdrop because purple is associated with royalty and the color of the setting sun connotes a warm, cozy, creative, and energizing feeling. Clear headings and easy-to-read paragraphs are used in the style, which is well-organized.</li>
                        <li><b>Navigation menu</b>:The upper right corner of the website is where you can find my navigation menu. My website has a simple, well-labeled navigation menu with distinct categories. Additionally, it has a hover effect to alert users to their presence.</li>
                        <li><b>Font-family</b>:In my website's headings for the various subjects, I used the arial rounded mt font family. In terms of playfulness, creativity, dependability, and trustworthiness, this typeface family conveys these qualities. The curves and rounded edges of this typeface are well-known. The font's design makes it simple to comprehend.In the body of topics with lengthy paragraphs, I've chosen serif font because it's simpler to read and has a formal, classic appearance.</li>
                        <li><b>Font-color</b>:I chose the color black for the text because it best complemented the backdrop and exemplified simplicity and elegance.</li>
                        <li><b>Animation</b>:To grab the viewer's focus, the name on the home page uses animation. </li>
                        <li><b>Layout</b>:To make the content stand out, box shadows are used. The page's center has been chosen as the alignment for all content.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="reflective">
                    <h3><span class="header-border">My learning Journey:A Personal Reflection</span></h3>
                    <p>Throughout the lesson, I learned a great deal of new knowledge. I was able to increase my skills from zero to a fundamental degree. Our module tutorial was very helpful in teaching us about a variety of topics. To help us grasp each topic, he both lectured and demonstrated. At this pace, I find learning to be enjoyable. With the help of Google, YouTube, and other tools, I also did study outside of the classes. Overall, this module greatly enhanced my ability to code, and I'm working to use it to build excellent web pages in the future.</p>

                <div class="problem">
                    <h3><span class="header-border">Challenges</span></h3>
                    <p>My section had fewer ups and downs than I had anticipated. I initially struggled to correctly link CSS and images with HTML. I was able to solve my issue after receiving assistance from friends and a tutor. I relied on a tutor and YouTube to become familiar with the git hub while using it. The coding was initially quite difficult, and occasionally my code didn't function. I had to invest a lot of time troubleshooting it to identify the issue.</p>
                    <p>Numerous difficulties were encountered when the site was in the development process. Picking the right backdrop was stressful. There were additional coding difficulties. The hover effect and active effect in the navigation bar did not function. Debugging took some time, but the issue was eventually resolved. The incorrect placement of the code was corrected with the assistance of the tutor. The responsive hamburger was one particularly difficult element. Despite extensive time spent on it, the responsive design did not function as intended. The challenge was conquered by utilizing the internet and Google.</p>
