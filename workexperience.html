                <div class="about-workexperience">
                    <p>As you know who I am,I started working when I was 17 years old. I had a job at a local coffee shop as a barista. Anyone who wants to work in a coffee establishment needs a barista certification. Beans House Coffee is the name of the cafe where I worked. I even received barista instruction there. The owner hired me as a new employee of his store after my training was complete. I made the most of every opportunity to improve my coffee-making abilities and attempted to offer good customer service.During my shift,my duties included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Making and offering a variety of coffee and tea beverages, such as espresso drinks, lattee drinks, iced drinks etc while maintaining  the shop's standards of quality and hygiene.</li>
                        <li>Keeping the workplace neat, orderly, and hygienic and ensuring that all the equipment is correctly maintained and sanitized.</li>
                        <li>Ensuring that all of the required ingredients are present in sufficient quantities.</li>
                        <li>Interacting with customers in a pleasant and respectful way.</li>
                        <li>Maintaining a correct cash register and efficiently handling transactions.</li>
                        <li>Maintaining accurate records of cash transactions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>During my tenure at Beans House Cafe, the management team recognized me for my dedication to my duties.</p>
                    <p>Overall, working as a barista has taught me the value of paying attention to detail, providing good customer service, and having the flexibility to work in a changing environment. </p>
